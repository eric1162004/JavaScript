//Generator Example

// Generator runs in right to left direction 
// .next() is like a play button of a generator
// A generator will not do anything unless you 'play' it
// yield is like a pause button of a generator
// whatever comes before the yield keyword in the code block becomes the value of the iterator object
// whatever passes to the .next(x) will be assigned to a variable after the yield keyword in the code block

function* gen(){
    let x = yield "pear";
    let y = yield "banana";
    let z = yield "apple";
   return x+y+z; 
}

let myGen = gen();

console.log(myGen.next());
console.log(myGen.next(1));
console.log(myGen.next(2));
console.log(myGen.next(3));
